		UpLang Release 0.0.x

INTRODUCTION

	Welcome to the code base of UpLang! Here are listed release notes for new versions for the project, tips on the language, how to install it, and much more.

ABOUT
	
	UpLang is a really light-weight programming language based on BASIC syntax. It was initially created as a fun side-project by Mattias Zurkovic. As of now, the written UpLang program is translated to C code, witch then gets compiled by either GCC of Clang.

RUNNING A PROGRAM

	Once you have written your .up UpLang program file you need to install the UpLand translator. To do this, you need to have the C source file and compile it. Once that is compiled and binded globally, run it as a C file and pass your .up program file as the first and only command line argument. This will translate the UpLang code and get compiled and executed!
